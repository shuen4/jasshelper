This is the source for the JASShelper. You require a win32 pascal (Delphi) to compile. I use Delphi 10 lite which is free and a really light download.


You can find many projects: 
'consolejasser': is the standalone compiler
'jasshelperdll" is the WEHelper plugin.
'jasshelperinstaller' is the installer for WEHelper
'grimoirejasshelper' is the source for mapcompiler.exe which would be soon used to allow JASShelper on grimoire once wehack.dll is officially released

The WEHelper plugin uses plugintypes.pas from WEHelper source (that's the way to make a WEHelper plugin, it provides access to the registering api and other functions).

In order to compile jasshelper.grm into jasshelper.cgt (if you modiffy) you need the Gold Parser Builder http://www.devincook.com/goldparser/ I am also including the source of the Delphi version of the parsing engine.
